##  Culture And Civilization 
We are not a nation built on civilization, but one wrapped in ancient culture. There is a fundamental difference between culture and civilization. Culture is often a passive inheritance—secular, traditional, and unexamined. Civilization, on the other hand, demands active construction: it is based on belief, reason, the rule of law, and the moral limits of human behavior.
Today, we still live by the rule of the jungle, where power defines right and winners take all. This is not civilization—it is a relapse into primal instinct. Culture may justify anything, even the grotesque, simply because "it has always been that way." But civilization draws a line. It tells us that just because something exists does not mean it is right. Without this line, we are not evolving—we are merely decorating savagery with ancient symbols.

##  文化与文明
我们不是一个建立在文明基础上的国家，而是一个被古老文化包裹着的国家。文化与文明之间有着根本性的区别。文化往往是一种被动的传承——世俗的、传统的，甚至是不加反思的。而文明则必须主动去建设：它基于信仰、理性、法治，以及对人类行为的道德边界。
如今，我们依然生活在丛林法则之中，权力决定是非，胜者通吃。这不是文明，而是对原始本能的倒退。文化可以为一切行为辩护，哪怕是最荒谬的，只要“它一直如此”。但文明划定底线。它告诉我们，某件事存在，并不意味着它就是对的。如果没有这条底线，我们就不是在进步，而只是在用古老的符号装饰野蛮。
