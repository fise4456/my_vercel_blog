## 事出有因-忆我的父亲

### 记得小时候，我的母亲经常在我们面前“控诉”我父亲家里的人，在困难时期，我父亲的两个哥哥是如何背着我们的爸妈，把我们父亲在农村的房子卖了，等等。因我们从小就觉得父亲的两个哥哥有些“坏”，甚至于认为我父亲的家庭有点不友善。以至于到我们十多岁了，也少有机会，或者是不想见到我父亲的哥哥，我们应该叫伯伯，及其他们的儿女。但是我父亲反而不太在意这类事情。
### 后来父亲陆陆续续给我讲他的家里的事情，我才逐渐对父亲的那个家庭有了一个比较真实的了解。
### 父亲那个家庭是一个比较富足的家庭，因为不穷,一家人相处也还比较和睦。我父亲的父亲是一个守着自己的小产业，苦苦经营的老实人。我父亲的大哥是一个教书先生，当过保长。爸的二哥也当过保长。我父亲的姐姐出嫁后，回娘家探亲期间，也不忘抓紧时间给家里的四个男人做鞋。可惜她因病过世早了一点。但是父亲对她却非常的敬重。
### 我父亲最应该感激的人应该是他的大哥，有意思的是我母亲对他大哥意见是最大。那时我父亲的的父亲，我们应该叫爷爷，希望我父亲能够继承爷爷的事业，文化有点就行了。但是他的大哥不采纳他父亲的意见，坚持要我父亲去读书。就是他到比较远的地方去当教书先生，他大哥也要把我父亲带到他去教书的学校读书。所以，后来我父亲才有可能考上成都的石室中学，直至考上四川大学。从这点来看，我父亲的大哥不愧是一个教书先生，眼光还是比旁边的许多人看的要远，当然对我父亲后来的人生也起了关键作用。
### 我父亲也很懂感恩。大哥的儿子和二哥的儿子上大学后，我父亲都分别给予了他们两个最大限度的资助。70年代我父亲还想方设法找到了他姐姐的女儿，也开始时常在经济上帮助她。
### 我父亲给我说，家里穷的话，家里的人的教养或者觉悟就不会太高。看来是有道理的。


## Reason--remembering my father
###  Remember, when we were children, my mother angrily complained to us about my father's family. During a hard time, my father's brothers sold my father's house in the village and did not inform my father, etc. So we thought that my father's family was not kind at that time, and we thought my father's brothers were bad. When we were teenagers, we did not meet my father's brothers. Or we did not want to see them at all. We should call them uncle. And did not want to see their children. But my father did not regard these matters. 

###  After my father spoke to me about his family more and more, I could understand his family and deeply see the reason. My father's family was a little rich, so all of the family were happy together because there were no problems with finances. My grandpa was a normal boss who managed a very small paper factory, he had hard made it run. My father's big brother was a teacher, he was a village manager, My father's second brother was also a village manager. After my father's sister was married, she made shoes for four men of my father's family in a short time during she went back home. Unfortunately, she died when she was a little young. But my father respected her very well.

###  My father should have gratituded his big brother most, but my mother thought that his big brother was not the kindliest. At that time, my grandpa hoped my father continue the family career, so education did not need more. But his big brother did not agree with Grandpa and persisted that my father ought to study. So my father's big brother took my father to the school for learning where his big brother worked as a teacher. Later my father went to a good advanced school, and then my father went to a good university. From this point my father's big brother was certainly a well-deserved teacher, he watched far more than others around him. The result of my father was from his big brother, who had a key role in my father's life after.

###  My father is very grateful to those who helped him. He supported his big brother's son and his second brother's son while they studied at a university. After many years, my father spent more time and difficulty finding his sister's daughter and gave her help with money often.    

###  My father told me that those would not have good behavior and good consciousness because their family was poor. So it makes sense.
