##  A True Story
This is a true story that happened close to me. It shows how illness can bring tremendous changes to a family.
The mother in this family was a kind and graceful woman. Before retiring, she held a good job. Her son secured a promising position after completing his studies abroad, and her husband had a respectable career. Together, they lived a happy and peaceful life.

One day, the mother began to feel unwell, suffering from frequent headaches. She was taken to the hospital for a check-up, which revealed that her blood pressure was abnormally high. The doctor advised her to go to a larger hospital for further tests, but she didn’t take it seriously and chose not to follow up.
A few days later, her condition worsened. Her blood pressure rose sharply, and her family rushed her to the hospital. She had suffered a brain hemorrhage and was taken into emergency surgery. Although the operation was successful, she didn’t regain consciousness immediately.
Two months later, she finally woke up—but she was no longer the same. The illness had left her severely disabled, and since then, she has required professional care day and night.
Her husband visited her in the hospital every single day, staying by her side through the long recovery. Her son, due to various reasons, had to quit his job. Eventually, he started working as a real estate salesman. By then, he was thirty-four years old and still unmarried.
A once joyful and promising family was forever changed by the mother’s illness.
This story reminds us that health is fragile, and life can change in an instant. We should cherish every moment of peace and health, and never take them for granted. Pay attention to the warning signs, take care of our loved ones, and live each day with gratitude.、

##  真实的故事
#### 这是一个真实的故事，发生在我身边。它告诉我们，疾病可能会给一个家庭带来多么深刻的改变。

#### 这个家庭的母亲是一位善良而优雅的女性。她在退休前有一份成功的职业。她的儿子在完成海外学业后，也找到了前景良好的工作，而她的丈夫则担任着一份受人尊敬的职务。他们一家人一起过着平静、幸福而充满希望的生活。

#### 有一天，母亲开始感到身体不适，经常头痛。家人带她去医院检查，结果显示她的血压异常偏高。医生建议她去更大的医院做进一步检查，但她并没有当回事，选择了忽视。

#### 几天后，她的病情突然恶化，血压急剧升高。家人紧急将她送往医院，她被确诊为脑出血，随即接受了紧急手术。手术虽然顺利完成，但她并没有立即苏醒。

#### 两个月后，她终于醒来——但她已经不再是从前的自己。病情导致她严重残疾，从那时起，她就需要专业护理人员日夜照料。

#### 她的丈夫每天都去医院看望她，始终不离不弃。她的儿子因种种原因不得不辞去原来的工作，最后做起了房地产销售。当时他已经三十四岁了，却仍然单身。

#### 这个曾经幸福、充满希望的家庭，因为母亲的疾病，彻底改变了模样。
