##  Good Times

#### Many people believe that good times simply mean that misfortunes are happening elsewhere—to others, not to themselves.It is peace by omission, a quiet bought with distance and chance. As long as suffering stays out of sight, they call the world kind.When storms rage far away, they close their windows and claim it’s a sunny day.They mistake absence for immunity, believing that fortune is their birthright.But fate has no favorites. One day, what they chose to ignore may arrive uninvited.

##  岁月静好

#### 许多人认为，所谓美好时光，就是苦难发生在别处、降临于他人，而自己安然无恙。那不过是一种被遗漏的安宁，是靠距离与侥幸换来的平静。只要苦难不在眼前，他们便说世界温柔。当风暴在远方肆虐，他们关上窗户，便自诩今日阳光明媚。他们把苦难的缺席误以为是永久的豁免，误以为幸运是与生俱来的恩赐。然而命运从不偏爱谁。那些他们选择忽视的，总有一天，会不请自来。
