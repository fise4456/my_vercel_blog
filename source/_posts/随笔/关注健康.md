## Focus on health
Health was never seen as the most important thing—until illness showed up in my own body.
For example, I used to ignore dental health when I was young. Now, at sixty-five, I realize I should have started protecting my teeth many years ago. Back then, I didn’t take it seriously and thought all those warnings were just tedious advice.
We really should follow the laws of science and listen to others’ suggestions.
The same goes for many other things in life.

## 关注健康
#### 健康从未被视为最重要的事——直到我身体出现疾病。
#### 例如，我年轻时常常忽视牙齿健康。如今，我65岁了，我意识到自己应该在很多年前就开始保护牙齿。那时，我并没有认真对待，觉得所有那些警告都只是些乏味的建议。
#### 我们真的应该遵循科学规律，听取他人的建议。
#### 生活中的许多其他事情也是如此。
