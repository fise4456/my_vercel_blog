## what do they live for

Many people spend their whole lives bowing and compromising — trying to be worthy of everyone but themselves. I truly believe this isn’t the life most of us long for.

Live fully in the present. Savor each day, each fleeting moment. Don’t dwell on the past you cannot change, nor chase after a future you cannot control. Let life unfold — what comes will come, and what goes is meant to go.

Most people, before reaching middle age, work tirelessly for their children and parents, enduring the scorn and pressure from their superiors. Then, after middle age, they spend 90% of their remaining time merely in exchange for the final 10% of life — called retirement.

## 为什么活在这个世界

#### 很多人窝窝囊囊一辈子，对得起这个、对得起那个，唯独对不起的就是自己，我相信这样的人生不是大多数人想要的；

#### 活在当下、活好当下，​享受每一天的每一刻，至于无法改变的昨天、无法把控的未来，就不要去纠结了，顺其自然，该来来该去去；

#### ​绝大多数人中年之前为孩子为父母，​拼命努力工作赚钱，忍受着上司和老板的白眼；中年以后再用人生90%的时间去换10%的养老。
